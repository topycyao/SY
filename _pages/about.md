üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I am a postdoctoral Fellow at Biostat and Bioinformatics Department in H.Lee Moffitt Cancer Center. I am currently working in Dr.Xuefeng Wang's lab. 
   I obtained my Ph.D at Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics in Stony Brook Univeristy (Advisor: Prof.Haipeng Xing). I also finished my Master's 
   degree in Stony Brook Univeristy and got my Bachelor's degree in Nanjing University, China.

üî¨ My research recent interests focus on different machine learning models in cancer survival data, generative deep learning models in single-cell transcriptomics data
   and causal inference in cancer patients' disparities.
   
Key words: Machine learning, Deep learning, Survival, Multiple kernel learning, Single cell, Causal inference, Time series 

I am currently looking for faculty jobs in stat/biostat and related fields.


Featured Projects
======
**GPS-Net: Discovering Prognostic Pathway Modules Based on Network Regularized Kernel Learning**

We introduce GPS-Net, a computational framework that fills the gap in efficiently identifying prognostic  modules by incorporating 
the holistic pathway structures and the network of gene interactions. By innovatively incorporating advanced multiple kernel learning techniques and network-based 
regularization,the proposed method not only enhances the accuracy of biomarker and pathway identification but also significantly reduces computational complexity, 
as demonstrated by extensive simulation studies.

**SmartImpute: A Targeted Imputation Framework for Single-cell Transcriptome Data**

-Yao, S., Yu, X., and Wang, X. (2024).
We present SmartImpute, a novel computational framework designed for targeted imputation of scRNA-seq data.SmartImpute focuses on a predefined set of marker genes,
enhancing the biological relevance and computational efficiency of the imputation process while minimizing the risk of model misspecification.

**Prediction-Oriented Prognostic Biomarker Discovery with Survival Machine Learning Methods**

we construct and compare a series of prediction-oriented biomarker selection frameworks by leveraging recent machine learning algorithms,
including random survival forests, extreme gradient boosting, light gradient boosting and deep learning-based survival models. Additionally,
We adapt the predicition-oriented marker selection (PROMISE) to a surivival model.
