**GPS-Net: Discovering Prognostic Pathway Modules Based on Network Regularized Kernel Learning**

We introduce GPS-Net, a computational framework that fills the gap in efficiently identifying prognostic  modules by incorporating 
the holistic pathway structures and the network of gene interactions. By innovatively incorporating advanced multiple kernel learning techniques and network-based 
regularization,the proposed method not only enhances the accuracy of biomarker and pathway identification but also significantly reduces computational complexity, 
as demonstrated by extensive simulation studies.

**SmartImpute: A Targeted Imputation Framework for Single-cell Transcriptome Data**

We present SmartImpute, a novel computational framework designed for targeted imputation of scRNA-seq data.SmartImpute focuses on a predefined set of marker genes,
enhancing the biological relevance and computational efficiency of the imputation process while minimizing the risk of model misspecification.

**Prediction-Oriented Prognostic Biomarker Discovery with Survival Machine Learning Methods**

we construct and compare a series of prediction-oriented biomarker selection frameworks by leveraging recent machine learning algorithms,
including random survival forests, extreme gradient boosting, light gradient boosting and deep learning-based survival models. Additionally,
We adapt the predicition-oriented marker selection (PROMISE) to a surivival model.

**Efficient Gradient Boosting for Prognostic Biomarker Discovery**

we present a new R package ‚ÄòXsurv‚Äô as an integrated solution that applies two modern GBDT training frameworks namely, XGB and LGB, for the modeling 
of right-censored survival outcomes.

**L1 Regularization for High-Dimensional Multivariate GARCH Models**

To address the spillover effect in high-dimensional stock market, We establish theoretical properties for estimators of L1 penalized GARCH models with
BEKK representations. We show the sparsity and the consistency of the proposed penalized quasi-maximum likelihood (PQML) and show that the proposed
outperforms some benchmark models.

### Interesting Ongoing Projects

**Causal Inference for Cancer Patients' Disparities**

We introduce an approach to causal inference within the Cox model tailored to socioeconomic data.
Acknowledging the multi-dimensional nature of socioeconomic factors, our method extends the convention binary
treatments to a multi-state causal inference framework. This approach aims to capture the nuanced impact of
socioeconomic variables on cancer survival across diverse states, providing a comprehensive understanding of
SES disparities in cancer survival.

**Transfer Learning with Neural Tangent Kernel Networks in Large Dataset**

A recent study utilizing projected dual preconditioned SGD for large-scale general kernel models, in conjunction with Neural Tangent Kernels (NTK), provide new potential for the multiple kernel machines to efficiently handle large datasets by leveraging deep learning frameworks.  We propose a transfer learning model by leveraging the computational efficiency and well-defined structures of Neural Tangel Kernel (NTK) in TCGA to CCLE 450K methylation data.
