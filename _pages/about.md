üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I am a postdoctoral Fellow at Biostat and Bioinformatics Department in H.Lee Moffitt Cancer Center. I am currently working in Dr.Xuefeng Wang's lab. 
   I obtained my Ph.D at Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics in Stony Brook Univeristy (Advisor: Prof.Haipeng Xing). I also finished my Master's 
   degree in Stony Brook Univeristy and got my Bachelor's degree in Nanjing University, China.

üî¨ My research recent interests focus on different machine learning models in cancer survival data, generative deep learning models in single-cell transcriptomics data
   and causal inference in cancer patients' disparities.
   
Key words: Machine learning, Deep learning, Survival, Multiple kernel learning, Single cell, Causal inference, Time series 

I am currently looking for faculty jobs in stat/biostat and related fields.

**GPS-Net: Discovering Prognostic Pathway Modules Based on Network Regularized Kernel Learning**

-Yao, S., Li, K., Li, T., and Wang, X. (2024)

The search for prognostic biomarkers capable of predicting patient outcomes, by analyzing gene expression in tissue samples and other molecular profiles, 
remains largely on single-gene-based or global-gene-search approaches. Gene-centric approaches, while foundational, fail to capture the higher-order dependencies
that reflect the activities of co-regulated processes, pathway alterations, and regulatory networks, all of which are crucial in determining the patient outcomes 
in complex diseases like cancer. Here, we introduce GPS-Net, a computational framework that fills the gap in efficiently identifying prognostic  modules by incorporating 
the holistic pathway structures and the network of gene interactions. By innovatively incorporating advanced multiple kernel learning techniques and network-based 
regularization,the proposed method not only enhances the accuracy of biomarker and pathway identification but also significantly reduces computational complexity, 
as demonstrated by extensive simulation studies.

**SmartImpute: A Targeted Imputation Framework for Single-cell Transcriptome Data**

-Yao, S., Yu, X., and Wang, X. (2024).

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revolutionized our understanding of cellular heterogeneity and tissue transcriptomic complexity. 
However, the high frequency of dropout events in scRNA-seq data complicates downstream analyses such as cell type identification and trajectory inference. 
Existing imputation methods address the dropout problem but face limitations such as high computational cost and risk of over-imputation. We present SmartImpute, 
a novel computational framework designed for targeted imputation of scRNA-seq data.SmartImpute focuses on a predefined set of marker genes, enhancing the biological 
relevance and computational efficiency of the imputation process while minimizing the risk of model misspecification.
